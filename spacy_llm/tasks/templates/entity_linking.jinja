For each of the MENTIONS in the TEXT, resolve the MENTION to the correct entity listed in ENTITIES.
Each of the ENTITIES is prefixed by its ENTITY ID. Each of the MENTIONS in the TEXT is surrounded by *.
For each of the MENTIONS appearing in the text, output the ID of the description fitting them best.
This ID has to be surrounded by single <>, for example <1>.
Make sure you make a choice for each of the MENTIONS. Prefix the solution for each MENTION with "--- ".
For each MENTION, describe your reasoning process in a single sentence.
